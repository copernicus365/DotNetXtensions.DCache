/// <summary>
/// A dictionary whose items expire after a set amount of time after
/// being set. This internally wraps a <see cref="ConcurrentDictionary{TKey, TValue}"/>,
/// allowing this type to be thread-safe, which makes sense for most cases
/// where a cached dictionary would be needed. The purging of items is handled extremely 
/// performantly, but passively (no embedded and complicated running timer). See notes on 
/// that below. But even though at a given time *internally* this dictionary may store
/// some items that have just expired (or even expired for some time), it is guaranteed
/// that no such expired items will EVER be returned, their existence will only be reflected
/// in the fact that they are counted in the normal <see cref="Count"/> of this dictionary.
/// We intentionally decided to not make that an outrageous calculation, but to simply
/// return the count of internal items. To get a count of items that haven't expired, 
/// you can call <see cref="CountNotExpired"/>, but that does take a full scan (just like 
/// <see cref="PurgeExpiredItems()"/>), and also note that the moment you get the value,
/// the count may still change 1 nanosecond later. 
/// For further details on how the items are actually purged internally, see further below:
/// <para />
/// With an eye on the Separation of Concerns as well as KISS principles, 
/// we've designed this type to NOT embed any kind of running timer that periodically and actively
/// removes expired items (by "actively" we mean: without any needed interaction with 
/// an instance of this type). Such would: 1) requires dependencies on timer types,
/// 2) need to try to be robust if the timer itself failed, leaving items building up in memory 
/// after expiration, and so forth. For these and other reasons it seemed best to
/// keep a full polling timer external to this type, but one can freely implement that,
/// just call <see cref="PurgeExpiredItems()"/> whenever desired.
/// <para />
/// On the other hand, we still have implemented passive means to purge expired items. These are:
/// 1) When an item's value is retrieved which has already expired, that item will be
/// internally removed, IMMEDIATELY. Then TryGetValue will return false.
/// 2) In addition, <see cref="RunPurgeTS"/>, which by default is set to 1 minute, is used to set 
/// a future expiration date added to UtcNow. A number of TRIGGER POINTS will always check first if
/// that time has expired (i.e. has it been 1 minute or more since a purge was attempted?).
/// If so then <see cref="PurgeExpiredItems()"/> is fired. Critically though, this
/// is NOT (!!) fired every time these trigger points are hit. These trigger points are:
/// a) When a lookup is made (TryGetValue, through the indexer, etc),
/// b) When an item is Set or Added, or 
/// c) when items are enumerated (this includes common LINQ calls, like ToArray, 
/// normal iteration of the collection, and etc). 
/// All of these triggers will fire a *highly performant* check, whose main cost is
/// a call to <see cref="DateTime.UtcNow"/> (which is in the nanoseconds range), plus a comparison 
/// of its value with an already calculated (internal) <see cref="_RunNextPurgeDT"/>.
/// This means no costly and outrageous extra operations are run for normal Get / Set (etc) operations,
/// as I saw some online caching dictionaries were architected. 
/// One must note that this is still a passive means of ensuring expired items get removed, so if 
/// this instance isn't interacted with for an hour, no purging of expired items will occur. If one critically 
/// needs such periodic purging without exceptions, then again, simply implement an external timer 
/// yourself and call <see cref="PurgeExpiredItems()"/> on the desired interval.

	/// from setting this to a much higher or a much lower number, because there is also
	/// a potentially heavy cost of keeping on expired items within the internal dictionary.
